<p>go-i2p allows cautious, disclosed use of LLM generated code under certain conditions.
This document attempts to provide transparency about that usage.</p>

<p>The enlightened position, in our opinion, is that LLMs cannot help you if you cannot think, and if you can think, then LLMs aren&rsquo;t really necessary.
However, what they are, fast word-predictors, can be useful for certain tasks(mostly by virtue of being fast).
Our advice is to use them for discovering issues in code which was written by a human.
Typically we do this by prompting the LLM to seek out issues in a small, focused section of the codebase, write a unit test demonstrating the issue, and generate a report about the issue.
We also asked the LLM to do package-level protocol compliance, code quality, and red-team reviews.
Then a human(idk, for instance) validates or invalidates the report and implements a fix.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that LLM&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;know&rdquo; things, they &ldquo;predict&rdquo; things while speaking in an authoritative voice.
They are sometimes good at making accurate predictions, but they will <em>always</em> behave as if they are perfectly correct.
They are absolutely worse-than-useless to people who are uncritical of their output.
You need to treat it like the dumb co-worker who proposed to port your whole codebase to a new language 6 years ago. #oddlyspecific</p>

<h2 id="llms-have-been-used-for">LLMs have been used for:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Test generation</li>
<li>Code review</li>
<li>Documentation suggestions</li>
<li>Refactoring suggestions</li>
</ul>

<p>Code review type usage produced freestanding bug reports in markdown documents, which were then reviewed and resolved by a human.</p>

<p>Allowing the LLM to generate tests has led to significant test accumulation. While this has been a small problem as new features have broken old negative tests which relied on <code>unimplemented</code> error messages, ultimately these negative tests were turned into unit tests and this is no longer a problem.</p>

<h2 id="llm-s-have-not-been-used-for">LLM&rsquo;s have <em>not</em> been used for:</h2>

<li>Non-test code.</li>
<li>Handling any long-term secret material(there is none)</li>
<li>No code or documentation of any kind(test or library) has been checked in without a human reviewer</li>
